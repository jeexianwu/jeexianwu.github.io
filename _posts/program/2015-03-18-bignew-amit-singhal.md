###Amit Singhal

阿米特‧辛格尔出生于印度北方邦,是搜索引擎公司Google的荣誉工程师。他的研究领域包括信息检索及其相关的网页搜索、网络图形分析及搜索用户接口等应用。阿米特还负责督导Google搜索质量小组，协助开发Google搜索算法。

辛格早年从师于搜索大师萨尔顿(Salton)教授，毕业后就职于 AT&T 实验室。在那里，他和两个同事半年就搭起了一个中等规模的搜索引擎，这个引擎索引的网页数量虽然无法和商用的引擎相比，但是准确性却非常好。在 AT&T，他对搜索问题的各个细节进行了仔细的研究，他的那些简单而有效的解决方案，常常是深思熟虑去伪存真的结果。

辛格非常鼓励年轻人不怕失败，大胆尝试。一次一位刚毕业不久的工程师因为把带有错误的程序推出到 Google 的服务器上而惶惶不可终日。辛格安慰她讲，你知道，我在 Google 犯的最大一次错误是曾经将所有网页的相关性得分全部变成了零，于是所有搜索的结果全部是随机的了。这位工程师后来为 Google 开发了很多好的产品。

辛格在 AT&T 时确立了他在学术界的地位，但是，他不是一个满足于做实验写论文的人，于是他离开了实验室来到了当时只有百、十人的 Google。在这里，他得以施展才智，重写了 Google 的排名算法，并且一直在负责改进它。辛格因为舍不得放下两个孩子，很少参加各种会议，但是他仍然被学术界公认为是当今最权威的网络搜索专家。

在[吴军博士](https://sites.google.com/site/junwu02/)的《数学之美》中也称其为“GoogleAK-47的制造者”，其在信息检索、语音检索、文档排序、问答系统等方面都有不俗的研究成果，拥有荣誉：

- 美国工程院院士

- 美国计算机学会荣誉会员

- 亚洲科技杰出贡献奖


主要研究领域见下(来自[Amit的个人主页](http://singhal.info/ "Amit Singhal")):

My research interests are in the area of information retrieval (IR), its application to web search, web graph  analysis, and user interfaces for search. Here are some of my selected publications (chronologically ordered). 
At Google I have worked on using IR techniques to improve web search. Before joining Google in 2000. 
I did research in the following sub-areas of Information Retrieval:


- Speech Retrieval:
 
	Increasing amounts of spoken communication are stored in digital form for archival purposes (for instance, broadcasts material). With advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, it is now possible to automatically transcribe speech with reasonable accuracy. Once transcribed, IR methods can be used to search speech collections. Think of this as a search engine for speech. However, the interesting problem is to search speech given large number of automatic speech recognition errors. More recently I have done some work in this area. When at AT&T Labs, we developed SCAN, a system that combines speech recognition, information retrieval and user interface techniques to provide a multimodal interface to speech archives.

- Document Ranking:
 
	Also called text/document searching/retrieval (that makes four phrases by the way), this is the best known part of our field. If you are reading this page, chances are that you have already used a "search engine" before. Document ranking is what search engines do: given a user query, how to rank a large collection of documents (web pages, news articles, your email, someone else's email that you happen to have hacked, ...) so that what you are looking for is ranked ahead of other less useful (or useless) documents.

- Question Answering: 
 
	People have questions and they need answers, not documents. Automatic question answering will definitely be a significant advance in the state-of-art information retrieval technology. Systems that can do reliable question answering without domain restrictions have not been developed yet.

	I organized the first few runnings of the QA Track under the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) umbrella to advance this sub-field of language processing.

- Document Routing/Filtering: 

	This is the "query by example" version of document ranking. Once you point the system to a few "good documents", the system then tracks all NEW documents and points you to only those ones that you should be looking at. Typically the system tries to find new documents that are similar to the documents that you said were good.

- Automatic Text Summarization: 
	
	Documents are huge and we don't always want to read them all. (I don't know about you but I certainly don't have the patience. And given the stuff you find on the web ...) Techniques that automatically "summarize" documents will be tremendously useful. Domain independent text summarization is very hard, at times even for humans; typically machines do summarization by text extraction. Relevant pieces (sentences, paragraphs, ...) of text are typically extracted and presented as a "summary".

- Miscellaneous (TREC): 

	Since 1992 National Institute of Standards in Technology (NIST) (along with DARPA) sponsors an annual conference called Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) to support research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies. I have been actively participating in TRECs since TREC-3 (held in 1994).

###Brief Bio
 
I was born in India in the state of Uttar Pradesh (Hindi, my native language, for "Northern State"). I spent most of my boyhood in the foothills of the Himalayas. I got a BS degree in Computer Science from University of Roorkee (now IIT Roorkee) in India, a MS, Computer Science again, from University of Minnesota (somehow, back then, I always found myself in cold places) and a PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University. At Cornell I studied with (late) Prof. Gerard Salton, one of the founders of the field of IR. Somewhere between my degrees I had real jobs doing database programming and IR system hacking. After my PhD I joined AT&T Labs in 1996. In 2000, my friend Krishna Bharat persuaded me to join Google.
